Future considerations:
1. Improve on sentiment analysis, if sentence mentions more than 1 dish, perform sentiment analysis on all of them
2. Improve dish items and category detection.  How would we handle 'chicken salad wrap'? Is this a salad? A wrap/sandwich? Both?
3. Improve recommendations (does a dish with one 5 star rating really better than a dish with 1000 reviews and a 4.5 rating?)
4. Determine dishes based on proximity using gps (latitude longitude)
5. Trending dishes shouldn't be based on the highest rating, rather a dish that is receiving many positive ratings in a recent short period of time
6. Add a way to order directly from the app, and then prompt the user for a rating on the dish that he/she ordered.
