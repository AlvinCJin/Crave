future considerations:
1. improve on sentiment analysis
2. improve recommendations (does a dish with 1 5 star review really better than 1 dish with 1000 reviews and a 4.5 rating?)
3. determine dishes based on proximity using gps (latitude longitude)
4. trending dishes shouldn't be based on the highest rating, rather a dish that is receiving many positive ratings in a recent short period of time
5. add a way to order directly from the app, and then prompt the user for a rating on the dish that he/she ordered.
