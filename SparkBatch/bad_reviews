i was going to leave a lengthy review but it seems that I'm not the only one who sees poor management when it comes to wait times and open tables never mind the people they turn away because they tell them 1-2 hour wait good way to invite them to the bar for a drink while they wait just an option rather then seeing $$ walk away considering you have open tables the girl who checks in people and takes there names needs an attitude adjustment and needs to understand what her job really entails she is not friendly not even fake friendly doesn't not seemed concerned that there were open tables and people were walking out i am a business owner and was furious to see the amount of people turned away and i have no stock in Zinburger either way the food is meh the burger buns were consistently soggy across our table 10-14$ for a burger with no sides other the three slices of a dry pickle that was cooked under the warming light is disgraceful the only reason i am leaving two stars at that is because our waiter was a great personality he has some crazy wavey hair and was conversational even though he forgot our over priced side of fries im glad he did because at that point it was 3 hours since we stepped foot in this place and i did not want to wait not a minute longer to be in my car and on my way home from a long day i even walked my check to the register to get the hell out of there so in full its poorly managed loud the restroom arrangement is ridiculous soggy buns and over priced under filled plates ohh i almost forgot my mother in law ordered the milk shake and it was more like a cup of ice cream that she ate with a spoon rather then a straw i even asked her how do you eat ice cream before dinner and i was corrected by her this is supposed to be a milk shake i never seen a milk shake in a rocks glass always in a tall shapely cola glass with whipped cream on top totally missed the mark on that one i also waited one whole day before i left this review as i dont usually review places but the girl at the check in was so rude i just had to voice my experience i will give them another shot not anytime soon but if that girl is still working there i will be the $$ that leaves to go to another place where you dont have to wait 3 hours for a soggy bun

she says and a chicken pita I said yes that's correct she says ok total is $$$ I handed her my card she kinda not all the way but almost positively snatched the card and closed the window I get my food go home and what do we have here my order is wrong Philly steak instead of a chicken Philly I go back tell the lady at the counter  that my order is wrong in the middle of her asking me what did you order drive thru girl slides literally and says you had the chicken Philly all they way no mushrooms I jus looked at her and said yes she yells literally to the cook make this a chicken Philly as I'm waiting I said to myself I don't want cold fries so I asked the lady at the counter hey are they gonna give me fresh fries or keep the ones I already have here comes drive thru girl again literally slides and says what's the problem so I continue to talk to the lady I originally started the convo with but she jus looked like this chick crazy do what she says and so the drive thru girl says WE GONE GIVE YOU SOME NEW FRIES WE AIN'T GONE GIVE YOU DA SAME ONES YEA...

:-)My buddy had a pizza...a custom pizza...the kind of pizza that I wish I could get Bianco's:)And we didn't have to wait 3 hours for Tommy V's pizza:)...they brought out his beautifully blistered, crusty and delicious, Quattro fromaggio with artichoke hearts and caramelized onions about 20 minutes after we ordered...just about right for a pizza order:)Once again, essentially edible art...smoky and delicious, hot from the oven...all the ingredients were perfectly proportioned (I think my friend has a special genius for ordering...this pizza wasn't on the menu, but clearly should be:)The price to portion and price to value ratio are so clearly positive at Tommy V's that I didn't even bother to create a chart...Under $30 for the 2 of us and we couldn't finish all the food...my Panini alone was over 12 inches across, cut into quarters...easily enough for 2 people, and included a wild greens salad in a light vinaigrette...wonderful:)We didn't try the bar out (lunchtime...on a Wednesday...meetings later...can't afford to look drunk:) although we did gawk a bit...an excellent selection of Italian beers, decent wines, scotches, vodka's...even bourbon's:)The only thing that was a bit jarring was the service...but not for lack of service!:)I don't want to rag on them for being too attentive, but they may want to throttle back on the love just a little...I was asked "how is everything" 3-4 times while I was in the middle of a conversation (we hadn't seen each other in while so we had a bunch to catch up on) or in the middle of a bite...listen...I really appreciate that so much more than the typical "where did everyone go?"

Between us all we had:* complimentary pickled cucumber ($4) - okay* 2 complimentary wood ears & tofu skins ($5) - really good tofu skins* 1 five spiced eggplant ($5) - eggplant was cooked well but the spicy sauce did nothing for me* 5 pork soup dumplings ($9) - not the best but probably as good as you can get in Pittsburgh, the skin was nice and delicate - a little too delicate at times as it was hard to get out of the steamer without losing the soup, the filling could be more tender though* 2 pork & crab meat soup dumplings ($11) - not worth ordering the crab, just stick to plain * 1 shrimp & loofah soup dumplings ($12) - interesting but again not as good as the plain pork, couldn't really taste the loofah* 2 vegetable dumplings ($9) - really great filling, probably my favorite dumpling* 2 rolled onion pancakes w/ sliced beef ($8) - okay, skip this* 4 pan fried green onion pancake ($6) - meh, skip this* 4 taiwanese style pork belly sliders($6) - everyone raves about this - including my family - but I didn't get it, the pork belly wasn't very tender though the sliders are huge - more like hamburger size* 2 noodles with minced pork sauce (zha zhang mian $7) - my favorite dish of the evening but I would expect as much from a restaurants that touts their hand pulled noodles - noodles were very chewy tasty and excellent* 1 Taiwanese style sesame cold noodles ($6) - didn't like the noodles in this as much* 2 sweet bean paste crispy pancakes ($7) - awesome, I ate a whole plate* complimentary creamy crispy mini bun ($4) - my family liked this but it just wasn't to my tasteMy picks if I were to come back are in ranked order 1) noodles with minced pork sauce (dry noodles), 2) sweet bean paste crispy pancakes (dessert), 3) vegetable dumplings, 4) pork soup dumplings.
